# 🧠 Practical AI Projects

**Stormfire presents: Practical AI Projects** – a living repository of real-world experiments, mental maps, notes and resources designed to make artificial intelligence not just understandable, but actionable.

> No hype. No black box. Just practical, ethical and empowering AI.

---

## 🔥 Purpose

This repo is for learners, practitioners, and curious minds who want to:

- Understand **how AI works** in practice.
- Explore real examples, tools and architectures.
- Learn by **doing**, not just reading.
- Connect theory with implementation.
- Rethink the way AI is taught and built.

---

## 🧭 Structure

Here’s what you’ll find (and what’s coming soon):

- `maps/` → Mental maps (AI architectures, prompt engineering, ethics…)  
- `notebooks/` → Practical experiments with real tools and models  
- `articles/` → In-depth reflections, studies and use cases  
- `resources/` → Guides, glossaries, references  

Everything is part of the **Stormfire learning methodology**: passionate, ethical, critical and hands-on.

## 💡 Philosophy

We believe in **open, human-centric, ethical AI**.  
We believe knowledge should be **shared**, not hidden.  
We believe in turning learning into **legacy**.
