> 🗣️ *This repository is written in English, but the core visual was designed in Portuguese to reflect the origin and identity of this journey.*


This is not just a repository — it's a digital journey.
It holds my transformation, my learning process, and my voice in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

## Who am I?
A Brazilian woman changing careers. 
I graduated during the pandemic and decided to redirect my life towards something I believe in: using AI to build more human, ethical, and impactful solutions.

## What is this for?
To organize my learning and share it with others who, like me, are building their path without shortcuts — just intention and curiosity.
