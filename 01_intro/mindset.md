# ðŸ’­ Stormfire: Mindset and Brutal Clarity

Welcome to the Stormfire AI trail.

This isn't just another repository on artificial intelligence.  
It's a manifesto. A map of those who chose to stop doubting their own ability - and started building with intention.

## ðŸ”¥ Why Stormfire?

Because for me, learning isn't linear.  
I'm not a spreadsheet, I'm a storm.  
My mind doesn't follow stairs, it follows trails, labyrinths, internal fires and rebirths.

Stormfire is the name that represents me.  
It was given to me by someone who saw in me not only potential, but identity.  
And that identity is made up of:

- Restlessness
- Courage
- And an uncontrollable desire to understand what burns behind technology

## ðŸš¨ Brutal clarity

I'm not here to look smart.  
I'm here to really understand.

That's why this track is going to be raw, objective and emotional at the same time.  
No unnecessary jargon. No magic formulas.  
Each stage is recorded as it really is: with mistakes, successes, doubts and discoveries.

## ðŸ§  What you'll find here

- Reflections on AI, society, language, power
- Practical tools for those who want to enter the field without a degree or shortcut
- Texts that mix technical knowledge with human depth
- A different way of learning: more intimate, more authorial, more mine

## ðŸ‘£ Who is this track for?

For those who feel they haven't yet found themselves in the world of technology.  
For those who are afraid of looking dumb.  
For those who have given up once, twice, ten times.  
And yet... **come back**. Because something inside insists.

If that sounds like you - 
then you've just found your trail.

## ðŸ’Œ A personal note

I started this journey during the pandemic.  
I had to reinvent myself, change areas, and deal with all the insecurities of not knowing where to start.  
But today, I'm here - building, learning, teaching.  
And I want to prove something to you:

**You can do it too.  
And you don't have to erase who you are to do it.
