# The Theft of the Century? The attack on C&M Software, PIX and the R$ 800 million at stake

> _When the vulnerability is not just technical, but structural._

---

## 🧠 What happened?

In the first week of July 2025, Brazil was the scene of one of the most impactful cyber attacks in its history. The company C&M Software, responsible for integrating financial institutions into the Central Bank's PIX system, suffered a serious security breach. The result? It is estimated that up to **R$ 800 million** was embezzled.

Investigations indicate that criminals used leaked credentials from C&M clients to access critical systems - including banks' reserve accounts - by exploiting flaws in the supply chain, also known as a supply chain attack.

## 💸 What are reserve accounts and why are they important?

Reserve accounts are held directly at the Central Bank and used exclusively for **interbank settlements** - in other words, they are the core of financial transactions between institutions. Gaining undue access to these accounts is equivalent to controlling the banking sector's own circulatory system.

## 🔐 The breach: credentials and trust

The attack wasn't technically sophisticated - it was strategic. It involved:
- **Misuse of customer credentials**
- **Exploitation of trust** between financial institutions and third-party providers
- **Lack of real-time monitoring of transactions on reserve accounts**

## 🧱 Supply chain: the weak link

The C&M case illustrates how a single vulnerable point in the chain can compromise the entire ecosystem. We call this a **Supply Chain Attack**: when the target is not the financial institution directly, but a reliable link in its infrastructure.

## 🔄 The challenge of converting to crypto

After the theft, the criminals tried to **convert the amounts into cryptocurrencies** (USDT and Bitcoin) using platforms integrated with PIX. The volume drew attention and many providers blocked the transactions. As a result:

- Several amounts were **recovered and returned**
- Some P2P vendors **stopped serving new customers** to avoid involvement
- Blockchain tracking quickly came into play

---

## 📉 Impact on service providers

C&M had its activities preventively suspended by the Central Bank. On July 3, the company announced the partial resumption of its services under a **controlled production** regime, with **strengthened transactional analysis** and limited opening hours.

The measure comes after emergency actions such as:
- Reinforcement of security protocols
- External audits
- Cooperation with the Civil Police and the Central Bank

## 🚨 Risks that this case highlights

1. **Blind trust in third-party providers**
2. **Unprotected access to critical systems**
3. **Difficulty in quickly tracing large sums**
4. **Delayed institutional response**
5. **Lack of transparency about affected institutions**

## 📌 Conclusion
