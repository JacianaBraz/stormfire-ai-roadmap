## 🐧 Getting Started with Linux

### 🔹 Why Learn Linux?
Linux is widely used in programming, cybersecurity, and AI environments. It's stable, secure, and gives you full control over your system.

### 🔹 Basic Commands Every Beginner Should Know

```bash
pwd         # Shows current directory
ls          # Lists files in the current directory
cd <dir>    # Changes to a different directory
mkdir <dir> # Creates a new directory
touch <file> # Creates a new file
rm <file>   # Deletes a file
```

Think of the terminal as your direct line of command to the machine. It might look intimidating, but it’s just a conversation — powerful and precise.

### 🔹 Package Management

#### Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install <package-name>
```

#### Red Hat/CentOS:
```bash
sudo yum install <package-name>
```

### 🔹 Useful Tools on Linux
- **htop** – Visual monitor of processes
- **nano** – Simple text editor
- **curl** – Transfers data from or to a server
