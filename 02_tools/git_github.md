# 🔧 Git & GitHub

Version control sounds boring — but it's the backbone of everything in tech.  
Git is how you track changes. GitHub is where you share them.

## 🧠 Why this matters

When you build something — a script, a dataset, a model — you want to keep control of what changed, when, and why.

Git is like a time machine for your work.  
GitHub turns that into a collaborative lab.

Learning this is like learning to breathe in tech. You won’t go far without it.

## 🖥️ GitHub Desktop (Yes, it's allowed)

If you're just starting, using the command line might feel like driving a spaceship.  
So here's your ally: [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

It’s a visual way to:

- Track changes
- Make commits
- Push and pull from GitHub
- Manage branches

It won’t teach you everything Git can do, but it *will* let you focus on your work without getting stuck.

> You’re not cheating. You’re learning.  
> The command line can wait.

## 📚 What you need to know

- **Git** is the tool. You install it and use commands to create snapshots of your project (commits).
- **GitHub** is the platform. You push your commits there to back them up or collaborate.

## 🛠️ Key Concepts

| Concept        | What it means                                                |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Repository     | A folder where your code and history live                   |
| Commit         | A snapshot of your project at a specific moment             |
| Branch         | A separate version of your work — great for experiments     |
| Push & Pull    | Push = send changes to GitHub, Pull = get updates from it   |
| Merge          | Combine two branches together                               |
| Clone          | Download a GitHub repo to your machine                      |

## 💡 Basic Workflow

1. `git init` → start a new project  
2. `git add .` → track all changes  
3. `git commit -m "message"` → save a version  
4. `git remote add origin URL` → link with GitHub  
5. `git push -u origin main` → send to GitHub  
6. Update with `git pull` when working in team

## 🔍 Commands to Remember

```bash
git status
git log
git checkout -b new-branch
git merge branch-name

You don’t have to master it all at once.
Just don’t skip it — this is your toolkit for building, breaking, and becoming.
